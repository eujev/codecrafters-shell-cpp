This repository contains my implementation of a basic shell as 
part of the [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) course.
The goal is to build a simple POSIX compliant shell that can execute commands, handle pipes,
redirect input/output, and more, all while implementing fundamental shell functionalities.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview)
to try the challenge.
